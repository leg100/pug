## FAQ

### Can I use the [provider plugin cache](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#provider-plugin-cache)?

Yes. However, because the plugin cache does not permit concurrent writes, if pug detects the cache is in use it'll automatically only allow one terraform init task to run at a time.
