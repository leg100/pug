## Install instructions

With `go`:

```
go install github.com/leg100/pug@latest
```

Homebrew:

```
brew install leg100/tap/pug
```

Or download and unzip a [GitHub release](https://github.com/leg100/pug/releases) for your system and architecture.

## Getting started

Pug requires `terraform` to be installed on your system.

The first time you run `pug`, it'll recursively search sub-directories in the current working directory for terraform root modules.

To get started with some pre-existing root modules, clone this repo, change into the `./demos/getting_started` directory, and start pug:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leg100/pug.git
cd pug
cd demos/getting_started
pug
```

At startup, pug lists your root modules:

![list root modules](./demos/getting_started/modules.png)

Initialize module `modules/a` by pressing `i`. That takes you to the task view, which includes the output from `terraform init`:

![init](./demos/getting_started/init.png)

Press `m` to show the corresponding module page for the task:

![module](./demos/getting_started/module.png)

You'll be presented with multiple tabs. To cycle through tabs press the `tab` key.

On the `workspaces` tab, press `p` to create a plan. That takes you to the `plan` tab in the run view, showing the output from `terraform plan`:

![plan](./demos/getting_started/plan.png)

A run is composed of a plan, and optionally an apply. Once the plan has completed, press `a` to apply:

![confirm](./demos/getting_started/confirm.png)

You're presented with a prompt to confirm whether you want to proceed with an apply. Press `y` to confirm. That takes you to the `apply` tab on the run view, showing the output from `terraform apply`:

![apply](./demos/getting_started/apply.png)

Note that pug automatically pulls state after a workspace is loaded for the first time, and after an apply completes.

To see the state resources for the workspace, press `w` and cycle through the tabs to the `resources` tab:

![resources](./demos/getting_started/resources.png)

This is the end of the getting started walkthrough.

## Configuration

Pug can be configured with - in order of precedence - flags, environment variables, and a config file.

Flags:

```bash
> pug -h
NAME
  pug

FLAGS
  -p, --program STRING               The default program to use with pug. (default: terraform)
  -w, --workdir STRING               The working directory containing modules. (default: .)
  -t, --max-tasks INT                The maximum number of parallel tasks. (default: 32)
  -f, --first-page STRING            The first page to open on startup. (default: modules)
  -d, --debug                        Log bubbletea messages to messages.log
  -v, --version                      Print version.
  -l, --log-level STRING             Logging level. (default: info)
  -c, --config STRING                Path to config file. (default: pug.yaml)
      --disable-reload-after-apply   Disable automatic reload of state following an apply.
```

Environment variables are specified by prefixing the value with `PUG_` and appending the equivalent flag value, replacing hyphens with underscores. For example, to set the max number of tasks to 100, specify `PUG_MAX_TASKS=100`.

The config file by default is expected to be found in the current working directory in which you invoke pug, and by default it's expected to be named `pug.yaml`. Override the default using the flag `-c` or environment variable `PUG_CONFIG`.

## Workspace Variables

Pug automatically loads variables from a .tfvars file. It looks for a file named `<workspace>.tfvars` in the module directory, where `<workspace>` is the name of the workspace. For example, if the workspace is named `dev` then it'll look for `dev.tfvars`. If the file exists then it'll pass the name to `terraform plan`, e.g. for a workspace named `dev`, it'll invoke `terraform plan -vars-file=dev.tfvars`.

## Resource hierarchy

There are several types of resources in pug:

* modules
* workspaces
* runs
* tasks

A task can belong to a run, a workspace, or a module. A run belongs to a workspace. And a workspace belongs to a module.

### Modules
 
*Note: what Pug calls a module is equivalent to a [root module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules#the-root-module), i.e. a directory containing terraform configuration, including a state backend. It is not to be confused with a [child module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules#child-modules).*

A module is a directory of terraform configuration with a backend configuration. When Pug starts up, it looks recursively within the working directory, walking each directory and parsing any terraform configuration it finds. If the configuration contains a [state backend definition](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration) then Pug loads the directory as a module.

Pug also checks if the module contains a `.terraform` directory. If it does not then the module is marked as *uninitialized*, because `terraform init` needs to be run before it can be deemed *initialized*.

Each module has zero or more workspaces. Following successful initialization the module has at least one workspace, named `default`. One workspace is set as the *current workspace* for the module. When you create a run on a module, the run is created on its current workspace. The latest run on its current workspace is set as the *current run* for the module.

If you add/remove modules outside of Pug, you can instruct Pug to reload modules by pressing `Ctrl-r` on the modules listing.

### Workspaces

A workspace is directly equivalent to a [terraform workspace](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/workspaces).

When a module is loaded for the first time, Pug automatically creates a task to run `terraform workspace list`, to retrieve the list of workspaces for the module.

When a workspace is loaded into Pug for the first time, it'll create a task that invokes `terraform show -json`, to retrieve the workspace's state.

If you add/remove workspaces outside of Pug, you can instruct Pug to reload workspaces by pressing `Ctrl-w` on a module.

### Runs

A run represents a terraform plan and the optional apply of that plan. Under the hood, it invokes `terraform plan -out <plan-file>`. Should you then apply the run, it invokes `terraform apply <plan-file>`.

A run starts in the `pending` state. It remains in that state until it can be scheduled. It can only be scheduled once all runs created prior to it on the same workspace have finished.

An exception to this rule is if the previous run is in the `planned` state. In which case the previous run is placed into the `stale` termination state, i.e. its plan file is deemed stale and cannot be applied.

Once a run is scheduled, it's placed into `scheduled` state and it's designated as the *current run* for the workspace.

If there are no blocked tasks running on its workspace and module (see tasks below) then the run transitions into the `plan queued` state. Once there is sufficient task capacity, the run enters the `planning` state, and `terraform plan` is invoked.

Once `terraform plan` completes, it enters one of several states depending upon the outcome of that task. If there were no changes, then it enters the `no changes` termination state, otherwise it enters the `planned` state.

When you apply a run, it enters the `apply queued` state. Once there is sufficient task capacity, the run enters the `applying` state and `terraform apply` is invoked. Upon success it enters the `applied` state. Pug then automatically creates a task to invoke `terraform show -json`, to retrieve the workspace's updated state. 

A run can be canceled at any stage. If it is `planning` or `applying` then the current terraform process is sent a termination signal. Otherwise, in any other non-terminated state, the run is immediately set as `canceled`.

### Tasks

Each invocation of terraform is represented as a task. A task belongs either to a run, a workspace, or a module.

A task is either non-blocking or blocking. If it is blocking then it blocks tasks created after it that belong either to the same resource, or to a child resource. For example, an `init` task, which is a blocking task, runs on module "A". Another `init` task for module "A", created immediately afterwards, would be blocked until the former task has completed. Or a `plan` task created afterwards on workspace "default" on module "A", would also be blocked.

A task starts in the `pending` state. It enters the `queued` state only if it is unblocked (see above). It remains in the `queued` state until there is available capacity, at which point it enters the `running` state. Capacity determines the maximum number of running tasks, and defaults to twice the number of cores on your system and can be overridden using `--max-tasks`.

An exception to this rule are tasks which are classified as *immediate*. Immediate tasks enter the running state regardless of available capacity. At time of writing only the `terraform workspace select` task is classified as such.

A task can further be classed as *exclusive*. These tasks are globally mutually exclusive and cannot run concurrently. The only task classified as such is the `init` task, and only when you have enabled the [provider plugin cache](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#provider-plugin-cache) (the plugin cache does not permit concurrent writes).

A task can be canceled at any stage. If it is `running` then the current terraform process is sent a termination signal. Otherwise, in any other non-terminated state, the task is immediately set as `canceled`.

## Tofu support

To use `tofu` instead of `terraform`, set `--program=tofu`.
