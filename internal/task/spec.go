	// module's dependencies. i.e. if module A depends on module B,
	// and a task is specified for both modules then the task for module A is
	// only started once the task for module B has completed. This option
	// only makes sense in the context of a task group, which constructs tasks
	// from multiple specs. All specs must set RespectModuleDependencies to
	// the same value otherwise an error is raised.

	// InverseDependencyOrder inverts the order of module dependencies, i.e. if
	// module A depends on module B, then a task specified for module B will
	// only be started once any tasks specified on module A have completed. This
	// is useful when carrying out a `terraform destroy`. This option only takes
	// effect when RespectModuleDependencies is true, and the spec is specified
	// as part of a task group. All specs in the task group must set
	// InverseDependencyOrder to the same value otherwise an error is raised.
	InverseDependencyOrder bool
	// Call this function before the task has successfully finished. The

	// the task to have failed and places the task into an errored state.
